# Quick start

This guide will help you start using the Wobbl3 ERC20 affiliate layer in your project. The affiliate layer enables your community to earn rewards for referring new users to your project. The protocol will work with any ERC20 token that has a liquidity pool on the following exchanges:

- Uniswap
- Sushiswap
- Balancer
- 1inch

## 1. Generate a referral link

To generate a referral link, you can go to your dashboard on Wobbl3.io and click on the "Generate a referral link" button. You will be prompted to enter the address of the token you want to use for the affiliate layer. You can also enter a custom referral code. If you leave the referral code empty, a random referral code will be generated for you.
