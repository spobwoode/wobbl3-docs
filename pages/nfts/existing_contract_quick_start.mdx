# Existing Contract - Quick start

This guide will help you get started with the Wobbl3 NFT smart contract integration using an existing NFT contract.

## Prerequisites

  * An ERC721-compatible NFT contract, deployed on a [supported blockchain](#which-blockchains-are-supported)

## Step 1: Deploy the Wobbl3 NFT Referral Contract

  1. Go to the [contract page on Third Web](https://thirdweb.com/)
  2. Connect your wallet
  3. Enter your mint function signature. For example, for the ThirdWeb ERC721 contract, the mint function signature is `mint(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
  4. Click 'deploy'

  Be sure to add an image to your ThirdWeb contract, as this will be used as the image for your referral page.

## Step 2: Go to the Mintboss Checkout page

  1. You'll now be able to mint and send referrals through to the Mintboss Checkout Page for your deployed Wobbl3 Referral Contract. The URL format is as follows: `https://mintboss.xyz/checkout/<contract_address>?network=<network_name>&r=<referrer_address>`
