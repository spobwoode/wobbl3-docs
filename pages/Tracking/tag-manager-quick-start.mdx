# Getting Started with Wobbl3 Tracking and Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Wobbl3 Tracking allows you to track incoming marketing activity (referrals, campaigns, etc.) and attribute it to on-chain events (transactions, smart contract interactions, etc.), enabling you to measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.

This guide will help you through the setup process of Wobbl3 Tracking with Google Tag Manager (GTM). If you are not familiar with GTM, we recommend you to read the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/quickstart) first.

## 1. Create a new Tag
