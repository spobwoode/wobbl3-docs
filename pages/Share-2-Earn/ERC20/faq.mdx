# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the Wobbl3 token affiliate protocol work?

The Wobbl3 token affiliate protocol is a way for projects to incentivize their community to promote their project. It works by providing a on-chain layer that allows projects to create a unique affiliate link for their community members to share. When a community member clicks on the link, they are taken to the wobbl3 Swap page for that project. When a user swaps on the wobbl3 Swap page, the affiliate link is stored in the transaction data. When the transaction is confirmed, the affiliate link is used to determine the affiliate that should receive the affiliate fee.

### How do I create an affiliate link?

Project owners can create an affiliate link on their wobbl3 dashboards.

### Do affiliates need to be whitelisted?

When creating your account on wobbl3, you have the option of selecting a whitelisted project or not. If you select a whitelisted project, only wallets that have been whitelisted by you will be eligible to receive affiliate fees. If you do not select a whitelisted project, any wallet will be eligible to receive affiliate fees.
