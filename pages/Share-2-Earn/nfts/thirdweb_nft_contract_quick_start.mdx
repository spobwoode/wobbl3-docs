# ThirdWeb NFT Contract Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you to get started with the Wobbl3 'Share-2-Earn' protocol on an existing ThirdWeb NFT smart contract. The Share-2-Earn protocol allows your community to earn rewards by sharing their referral links with others. When a user mints an NFT using a referral link, the referrer will receive a percentage of the mint price as a reward.

## Prerequisites

- A ThirdWeb 'NFT Drop' smart contract deployed on an EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g. Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.)

## Step 1: Add an allowlist entry for the Wobbl3 Share-2-Earn Protocol contract

1. Under the 'Claim Conditions' tab, edit your claimer snapshot to include the Wobbl3 Share-2-Earn Protocol contract address on the relevant chain. You will need to be using a 'Public (With Allowlist)' or 'Allowlist Only' claimer snapshot.
2. We recommend granting the protocol contract a discounted price. This will incentivize users to claim using referral links and offset the cost of the referrer's reward. A 10-20% discount is recommended but a higher discount may be used if desired.
3. Save the changes.

## Step 2: Visit the Mintboss mint page

Mintboss is a tool that allows your community to generate referral links and mint using the Wobbl3 Share-2-Earn Protocol. For Thirdweb contract, Mintboss URLs follow the following format:

```
https://mintboss.xyz/tr/<nft_contract_address>?chain=<chain_name>
```

For example, if your NFT contract address is `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456789` and you are deploying on the Ethereum mainnet, the URL would be:

```
https://mintboss.xyz/tr/0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456789?chain=ethereum
```

## Step 3: Start generating referral links

Click on the 'Share 2 Earn' link below the mint button to generate your first referral link. You can choose the referral reward percentage and enter any address to generate a referral link. You can also use the 'Copy Link' button to copy the link to your clipboard.
