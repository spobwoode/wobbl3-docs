# Existing Contract - Quick start

This guide will help you get started with the Wobbl3 NFT smart contract integration using an existing NFT contract. It works best when your contract allows you to add an allowlist discount. This way, you can add the Wobbl3 Protocol contract address as your only allowlist entry and choose a discount to offer to your referrers. Discounts incentivise referrers to send more referrals, so we recommend offering a discount of at least 10%.

## Prerequisites

  * An ERC721-compatible NFT contract, deployed on a [supported blockchain](#which-blockchains-are-supported)

## Step 1: Create an allowlist entry for the Wobbl3 Protocol contract

  1. Create an allowlist entry for the [Wobbl3 Protocol contract address](/wobbl3_protocol_contract_addresses). This will allow anyone minting through a referral link to receive a discount.
