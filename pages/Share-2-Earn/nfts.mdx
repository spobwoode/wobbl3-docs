# Share-2-Earn NFT Protocol

- An affiliate layer for NFT mints
- Leverage your existing community to sell out your NFT mint
- Quickly create an on-chain referral program for your NFT mint

## How it works

The layer is a smart contract that allows you to create a referral program for your mint. It's a simple contract that allows you to set a referral fee and instantly generate an affiliate link. When a user buys an NFT through the referral link, the referral fee is automatically paid instantly on-chain.

## Recommended Usage

- Offer a discount to users who use a referral link
- Set a referral fee of 10-20% to incentivize your community to share your mint
- Promote the affiliate program to your community and encourage them to share their referral links
